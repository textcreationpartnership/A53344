            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>ON HIS MAJESTIES Sending The RIGHT HONOURABLE Henry Earl of CLARENDON To the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1685.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WHen Man was made Vice-gerent here below,</l>
               <l>The King of Heaven nobly did bestow</l>
               <l>Perfections on Him, numerous and great,</l>
               <l>To answer all the ends of Regal State:</l>
               <l>And now, our Earthly God, a Man has sent</l>
               <l>Compleatly qualify'd for Government:</l>
               <l>A man so like Himself, in Him we see</l>
               <l>Great <hi>James</hi>'s Wisdom, Love and Clemency:</l>
               <l>So the rich Works of an Almighty hand</l>
               <l>Declare that Power which do's them all command.</l>
               <l>As many Stars can never make a Sun,</l>
               <l>But grow into a Constellation;</l>
               <l>The brightest Virtues which adorn a Throne</l>
               <l>Happily meet and shine in <hi>Clarendon,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Tho Majesty resides in <hi>James</hi> alone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>No wonder that our King so long delay'd;</l>
               <l>The work deserv'd the wisest Council's aid:</l>
               <l>Great Projects need the most delib'rate thought,</l>
               <l>And are, unto Perfection, slowly brought.</l>
               <l>Heav'n seems to have consulted, when 'twas said,</l>
               <l>Let Us make Man; a man to be obey'd</l>
               <l>By all that fill the Air, the Sea and Land;</l>
               <l>As wide o're Us is <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Command:</l>
               <l>And in this State may He securely stand;</l>
               <l>Supported by his Mighty Maker's Hand.</l>
               <l>If Innocency can his fall prevent,</l>
               <l>He must stand firm and long in Government.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Long lay our bodeing minds 'twixt Hope and Fear,</l>
               <l>But when the Royal Pleasure did appear</l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:38239:2"/>
               <l>For <hi>Clarendon,</hi> to Rule and save our State;</l>
               <l>Bless'd was the Issue of the Grand Debate:</l>
               <l>The God-like work we saw and understood,</l>
               <l>And cou'd not but confess, 'twas very good.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The world must own that Kings are Gods below,</l>
               <l>So opportunely Blessings they bestow:</l>
               <l>The Nation do's not wish (since <hi>Ormond</hi>'s gone)</l>
               <l>A nobler Vice-Roy here than <hi>Clarendon:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Our King and Providence together move</l>
               <l>Both in our saddest state express their love;</l>
               <l>Both suddenly our biggest Hopes destroy;</l>
               <l>And both as seasonably improve our Joy:</l>
               <l>When <hi>Charles</hi> (our Dearest Monarch) was no more,</l>
               <l>Heav'n in a Brother did our Bliss restore;</l>
               <l>And th' loss which We, in <hi>Ormond,</hi> did sustain,</l>
               <l>Our <hi>King,</hi> in <hi>Clarendon,</hi> makes up again.</l>
               <l>A greater New-years-gift, we can't receive,</l>
               <l>Nor can a Gen'rous King a Greater give.</l>
               <l>Long may we have from <hi>James</hi>'s Royal Hand</l>
               <l>This Gift continu'd to our grateful Land:</l>
               <l>And on his Sacred Head may Heav'n repeat</l>
               <l>The Joys of Peaceful <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great.</l>
               <l>Thrice happy Prince! well hast thou understood</l>
               <l>To joyn thy Honour with the Kingdoms good:</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Clarendon</hi> must Peace and Plenty bring,</l>
               <l>And keep all Subjects Loyal to their King:</l>
               <l>More glorious still, thro Him, our King shall grow,</l>
               <l>Till <hi>James</hi> triumphs above, and <hi>James</hi> triumphs below.</l>
